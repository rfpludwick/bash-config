# About

**bash-config** is really just my personal Bash configuration. So, yeah.

# Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rfpludwick/bash-config .bash-config
.bash-config/install.sh
```

Installing without `git` on the system?

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- hhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfpludwick/bash-config/master/install-no-git.sh)
```
